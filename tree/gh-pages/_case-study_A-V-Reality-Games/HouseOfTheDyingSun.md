# House of the Dying Sun

House of the Dying Sun is a tactical space shooter that puts you in the cockpit of “the universe’s most terrifying starfighter” for Virtual Reality space combat. The game will appeal to anyone who saw Star Wars and thought to themselves, “I’d LOVE to fly that X-Wing and blow up the Death Star!” — so everyone, basically. Marxent Marketing Creative Director Joe Johnson has played through House of the Dying Sun, and calls the game “An example of how VR can completely change the gaming landscape, reviving a long dormant game archetype. It’s outstanding.”
