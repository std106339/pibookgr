# Elite: Dangerous

Though Elite: Dangerous has been floating around since last year (by late last year you could get it to run on the Oculus Rift developer’s kit with minimal hacking), we’re going to consider it a 2016 release since the official Rift version launched in March. The game itself is pretty spectacular, and has really grabbed the attention of Marxent Program Manager Shawn Rothery. “I like it so much I’m building a cockpit with motion simulation for it!” he says. “For the record, Elite looked like this the first time I played it: Keep the ‘You’re so old…’ jokes to yerself. Newbs.”
