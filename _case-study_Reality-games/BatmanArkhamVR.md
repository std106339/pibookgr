# Batman Arkham VR

Superhero titles and VR seem like a match made in comic book heaven, and early looks at Batman Arkham VR have fanboys counting the days until they can put on the mask and fight crime as the Caped Crusader. There’s a natural synergy between strapping on a VR headset and donning Batman’s cowl, which will make it easy for players to suspend disbelief and get lost in Virtual Gotham. The teaser trailer has us excited, as does the advance hype on the game, which is calling it “the beginning of the Virtual Reality experiences we need.” Batman Arkham VR is expected to be released in October, along side the heavily anticipated PlaystationVR.
